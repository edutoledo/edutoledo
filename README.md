Technical Experience
--------------------

* **Ruby on Rails:** Extensive professional experience working at Collage and CareGuide. Used as the backend service for a RESTful API server (Collage) and as the backend GraphQL server (CareGuide)

* **React.js:** Extensive professional experience working at Collage and CareGuide. Used for frontend withMobX (Collage) and Next.js with TypeScript

* **JavaScript:** Professional experience using JS, specifically for frontend work in React.js, TypeScript and Next.js

* **TypeScript:** Used in CareGuide in conjunction with React and Next.js for strong type-checking that led to cleaner and clearer code

* **Next.js:** Framework built on top of React that simplifies frontend app development. It does things like a better routing system, pre-configured compilation, and more control over Server Side Rendering (SSR)

* **GraphQL:** Gained much experience while working at CareGuide. Frontend communicated to the backend exclusively via GraphQL queries and mutations

* **Kubernetes:** Hands-on experience working with Kubernetes while at CareGuide

* **Cloud Computing:** Professional experience using Amazon Web Services (AWS), touching many aspects of the deployed products such as DB (RDS), simple file hosting (S3), running servers (EC2 and EKS), memory caching (ElastiCache)

* **elasticsearch:** Used at CareGuide for blazing fast and efficient querying of listings and other data

* **Docker:** Used at CareGuide and Collage for compiling/building and deploying images used by EKS (AWS Kubernetes service) to run their servers. Used in local development environments to simplify first-time setup by running local containers of the DB, redis and elasticsearch

* **git:** Used through most of my professional experience as the VCS. Mainly using GitHub as the central repository, sometimes hosted locally in GitLab. Created PRs (pull requests) that were peer-reviewed to ensure quality and clarity. Merged the approved changes into the master branch for compiling and deployment

* **CI/CD (Continuous Integration, Continuous Delivery):** At Collage and CareGuide, all merges to the master branch triggered a build in CircleCI. Generated Docker images could then be deployed to staging and production

* **Agile methodology:** Used Scrum at Nulogy and Collage, with weekly planning and backlog grooming meetings and 2-week sprints. At CareGuide we followed Kanban. The Product team constantly ordered the backlog by priority, so you always worked on the next ticket that was assigned to you or assigned to no one, whichever came first

* **CMS:** Experience using Contentful to store, update and retrieve images and other assets

* **Cloudflare:** Experience using Cloudflare for edge caching

* **Java:** Extensive professional experience while developing NexJ Studio. Used in many Computer Science courses at the University of Waterloo

* **C#:** Professional experience developing ASP.NET tools and working on PriceMetrix’s products

* **C/C++:** Experience building projects for various courses at the University of Waterloo

* **SQL:** Extensive professional experience. Regularly built queries to provide integration usage and volume data at Nulogy. Using RoR ActiveRecord to read, write and update data to the DB (PostgreSQL and MySQL)
