Technical Experience

Programming Languages
- **XSLT 1.0:** Used for Nulogy's internal integrations platform. Interesting to use due to the fact that you're always thinking in a recursive manner, so to emulate looping and "variables" you always have to use recursive template calls.

- **Java:** Used at NexJ for developing NexJ Studio. Also used in some courses at University of Waterloo.

- **Go:** Personally learning by working on small personal projects

- **SQL:** Learned at university, used at Nulogy to provide integration usage and volume data.

- **C#:** Used when developing **ASP.NET** tools and working on PriceMetrix's products.

- **C/C++:** Learned and used for various courses at University of Waterloo.

- **Scheme:** Learned and used for University of Waterloo's initial Computer Science courses, uses recursion, discourages mutations.

- Basic knowledge of **HTML**, **CSS**, **JavaScript**. Some experience with **React** library, learning together with **TypeScript**. Some knowledge of **terraform**, specifically for deploying to **AWS**.
